- 👋 Hi, I’m @meilings91, a PhD student at University of Nottingham, Malaysia.
- 👀 I’m interested in numerical cognition, learning difficulties, neuroimaging techniques (MRI, fMRI, EEG, PET) as well as education policy in Asia. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Python (really really beginner level).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cross-cultural research on mathematics learning/numerical cognition.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach me through Twitter (@sohmeiling)
